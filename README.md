# etch-a-sketch
A simple digital Etch-A-Sketch within the browser for desktop/laptop computers using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project was created to not only practice JavaScript, but also CSS box-shadows to improve the dimensional look of HTML elements, in this instance the Etch-A-Sketch device.
